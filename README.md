### ComboBox Component

The ComboBox component is a custom implementation of a combo box UI element built using React. It combines a drop-down list and an input text field, allowing the user to select a value from the list or start typing to narrow down the available options.

### Features

Dropdown list with selectable options
Input text field for filtering options
Support for keyboard, touch, and other input methods
Auto-closing when interacting with other elements
Accessibility features
Animations
Responsive design for small screens

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone git@github.com:Funnydev1031/my-combo-box.git

2. Change into the project directory:
   cd comboBox

3. Install the dependencies:
   npm install

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
